## Exercise Categories

### Introduction to Classes and Objects
- Basic class definition with attributes and methods
- Creating objects and calling member functions
- Constructors (default and parameterized)

### Constructors and Destructors
- Constructor overloading
- Destructor implementation
- Object lifecycle management

### Encapsulation
- Private vs public access specifiers
- Getter and setter methods
- Data validation in setters

### Pointers and Classes
- Creating objects with pointers
- Pointer to existing objects
- Arrays of object pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation

### Polymorphism
- Virtual functions and method overriding
- Base class pointers to derived objects
- Dynamic casting

### Memory Management
- `new` and `delete` operators
- Memory leak prevention
- Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)

### Advanced Topics
- Operator overloading
- Copy constructors and assignment operators
- Deep vs shallow copying
